  <p>Ajay was a young man who had moved to the city chasing his dreams.Busy in his job, he hardly called home.His mother would wait every evening near the old telephone, hoping to hear his voice.
</p>
<p>One day, he received a letter from his little sister.</p>It read:
"Mom hasn't been well. She misses you a lot. She still waits by the phone every evening."

Ajay heart sank.He realized how far he had drifted from the people who loved him the most. <p>That very night, he packed his bags and took the earliest train home.

When he reached, his mother was sitting in her usual chair, frail but smiling. She held his hand, tears in her eyes.
 </p><p>"I knew you'd come," she whispered.

Sometimes, the greatest success is not in the city lights, but in the warmth of the people waiting for you back home.</p>
